    <b>📌 Project Introduction</b>
</h2>

- Duration: 10.31.23 ~ 12.08.23
- Team Project - Backend Team (5 members)
- #### The purpose behind this platform
> Every year, the number of people who consider their dogs as part of the family continues to grow. </br>
However, there are practical difficulties when it comes to meeting neighboring dogs and fostering social skills. </br>
Therefore, a platform is needed where pets can meet other dogs in the neighborhood to develop their social skills, and ultimately, interact with the people in the community as well.

- #### You can find the development notes and process on our Notion page: [Development Notion Page](https://fishy-mammal-3dc.notion.site/99e5d0c534924514b162c76193664544)
